# Description
This is an example Letter of Intent template for the ongoing Snowmass Process in the
United States.  The reason this exists is to uniformize the way these are presented and 
hopefully provide some semblance of order for when conveners and others digest your
ideas.  It is not necessary to use this but hopefully also not terribly challenging.

# Authors
This template originated with the [Cosmic Frontier](), 
was taken/borrowed/acquired by the [Neutrino Frontier](), 
and has been morphed for use by the [Community Engagement Frontier]().  Feel free to fork
the repository and use it for your own LoI or for that of your group/frontier.
